Sure, I'd be happy to help you design and implement a UDP-based RPC (Remote Procedure Call) system in Python using asyncio. Before jumping into coding, let's first outline the design and key components of your system. Here's a structured way to approach this:

### Key Components

1. **RPC Server**: Listens for incoming UDP packets, decodes them to identify the requested method and its parameters, executes the method, and sends the response back to the client.
2. **RPC Client**: Sends method invocation requests to the server via UDP and waits for a response.
3. **Method Registry**: A way to register methods that can be remotely called. This can involve some form of annotation or decorator to mark methods as remotely accessible.
4. **Transport Layer**: Handles the UDP communication. It should be capable of sending messages and receiving responses asynchronously.
5. **Message Serialization**: Converts method calls and responses to/from a format suitable for network transmission (e.g., JSON, MessagePack).

### Design Considerations

#### UDP vs TCP for RPC
- **Reliability**: UDP does not guarantee delivery, order, or error-checking, which are usually desired in RPC systems. You will need to implement your own mechanism for these if necessary.
- **Performance**: UDP is generally faster than TCP because it is connectionless and does not involve overhead for connection setup and maintenance, which might be why you chose it for your RPC system.

#### Asynchronous Operation
- **Concurrency**: Using asyncio allows your server to handle multiple requests concurrently without the need for multi-threading or multi-processing. This can improve performance under load.
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Essential for not freezing the server or client while waiting for network I/O operations.

#### Endpoint Design
- **Class-based Endpoints**: Each service can be encapsulated in a class, and methods of these classes can be exposed as RPC endpoints.
- **Decorators for RPC Methods**: A decorator can be used to register methods as callable over RPC, which helps in automatically registering these methods on server start.

#### Error Handling
- **Timeouts and Retries**: Since UDP does not guarantee delivery, your client might need mechanisms to retry sending a request if a response is not received within a certain timeout.
- **Exception Handling**: Both the server and client need to properly handle exceptions. The server should catch exceptions in method executions and send meaningful error information back to the client.

#### Serialization
- **Data Format**: Choose a serialization format that supports the data structures you need to send over the network and is lightweight. JSON is human-readable and supported widely, while MessagePack is binary and more efficient.

### Example Structure

1. **RPC Decorator**: Marks methods that can be called remotely and possibly adds them to a registry.
2. **Server Class**:
   - Initializes a UDP socket.
   - Listens for incoming requests and dispatches them to the correct method.
   - Sends responses back to clients.
3. **Client Class**:
   - Sends RPC requests to the server.
   - Waits for and handles responses.
4. **Classes/Methods as Services**: Define business logic in classes whose methods can be remotely invoked.

Would you like to proceed with this design, or are there specific aspects you'd like to adjust or expand upon?

Thank you for your insight, I've replied inline, please add your replies inline too, to help manage the conversation structure

### Key Components

1. **RPC Server**: Listens for incoming UDP packets, decodes them to identify the requested method and its parameters, executes the method, and sends the response back to the client.
2. **RPC Client**: Sends method invocation requests to the server via UDP and waits for a response.

> combine these into one, I think we should assume at some point we will use a p2p approach, but given the dense network I'm using I think DHTs are likely an overkill.  Probably just share a union of known endpoints as one of the rpcs.  Perhaps we should provide unioned sets and CRDTs?

3. **Method Registry**: A way to register methods that can be remotely called. This can involve some form of annotation or decorator to mark methods as remotely accessible.

> agreed

4. **Transport Layer**: Handles the UDP communication. It should be capable of sending messages and receiving responses asynchronously.

> I think it should be threaded or asyncio, especially as we want to be able to read and write files without blocking other messages, and we want to use the full performance of the cpu

5. **Message Serialization**: Converts method calls and responses to/from a format suitable for network transmission (e.g., JSON, MessagePack).

> I have used both in the past, messagepack is probably a reasonable choice given its compact representation and efficient handling of byte-strings.  What other formats would you consider?  I think protobuf and thrift are impractical as they need a separate compiler, pickle is ok, but has security concerns, others?

### Design Considerations

#### UDP vs TCP for RPC
- **Reliability**: UDP does not guarantee delivery, order, or error-checking, which are usually desired in RPC systems. You will need to implement your own mechanism for these if necessary.
- **Performance**: UDP is generally faster than TCP because it is connectionless and does not involve overhead for connection setup and maintenance, which might be why you chose it for your RPC system.

> Yes, I want to move the reliable delivery up a layer as my application needs to handle this problem in any case, and will include things like replication and multistage commit.


#### Asynchronous Operation
- **Concurrency**: Using asyncio allows your server to handle multiple requests concurrently without the need for multi-threading or multi-processing. This can improve performance under load.
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Essential for not freezing the server or client while waiting for network I/O operations.

Can files be written non-blocking too with this?

#### Endpoint Design
- **Class-based Endpoints**: Each service can be encapsulated in a class, and methods of these classes can be exposed as RPC endpoints.
- **Decorators for RPC Methods**: A decorator can be used to register methods as callable over RPC, which helps in automatically registering these methods on server start.

> Yep

#### Error Handling
- **Timeouts and Retries**: Since UDP does not guarantee delivery, your client might need mechanisms to retry sending a request if a response is not received within a certain timeout.

> Are there any patterns that help organise the idea of end-to-end phased-commit - so rather than making each step reliable, instead we trace the message from source to end, and allow for scatter and gather and rollback as a primative?  I can imagine a collection of building blocks that work a bit like a generator (maybe generators are a good place to start?) and handle the errors robustly.

- **Exception Handling**: Both the server and client need to properly handle exceptions. The server should catch exceptions in method executions and send meaningful error information back to the client.

> Again, perhaps it's better to include the errors as part of the main program specification?

#### Serialization
- **Data Format**: Choose a serialization format that supports the data structures you need to send over the network and is lightweight. JSON is human-readable and supported widely, while MessagePack is binary and more efficient.

> good points, see earlier comments

### Example Structure

1. **RPC Decorator**: Marks methods that can be called remotely and possibly adds them to a registry.

> sounds good

2. **Server Class**:
   - Initializes a UDP socket.
   - Listens for incoming requests and dispatches them to the correct method.
   - Sends responses back to clients.
3. **Client Class**:
   - Sends RPC requests to the server.
   - Waits for and handles responses.
4. **Classes/Methods as Services**: Define business logic in classes whose methods can be remotely invoked.

------------------------


#### Combined RPC Server and Client
- **P2P Approach**: Merging the server and client functionalities into a single component makes sense for a P2P system. As you mentioned, using a shared known endpoint list or a union of sets for keeping track of peers can work well without the complexity of DHTs. CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types) could be beneficial for resolving inconsistencies in data states across nodes without central coordination.

> accepted, let's do that

#### Asynchronous and Non-Blocking I/O
- **Asyncio vs. Threading**: Using asyncio is a good choice for handling I/O operations efficiently on multiple connections. Since asyncio is inherently non-blocking and works well with Python's async features, it can handle file I/O operations without blocking other activities. Python's `aiofiles` package can be used for non-blocking file operations.

> excellent, let's do that

#### Serialization Formats
- **MessagePack**: This is a good choice for efficient binary serialization. Regarding other formats, considering your needs and constraints:
  - **Protobuf and Thrift**: Require separate compilation steps and are not as straightforward to implement dynamically as JSON or MessagePack.
  - **Pickle**: Not recommended due to security vulnerabilities when loading pickled data from untrusted sources.
  - **CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation)**: Could be another alternative, similar to MessagePack but with some differences in feature set and efficiency.

> cbor2 does look good, are there any benefits you know of for msgpck over cbor2?

#### End-to-End Reliability on Top of UDP
- **Reliable Delivery Mechanisms**: Implementing reliable delivery as a separate layer allows you to design custom behaviors tailored to your application's requirements, such as handling replication or multi-stage commits. 

> agreed, let's do that

#### Error Handling and Rollback Mechanisms
- **End-to-End Phased Commit**: Using transaction-like mechanisms for managing RPC operations can be beneficial. You might consider implementing a protocol similar to two-phase commit but adapted for your asynchronous and potentially non-reliable transport:
  - **Phase 1**: Prepare and vote on commit.
  - **Phase 2**: Commit or rollback based on votes.

> Would it be hard to incorporate RAFT consensus here?

- **Scatter and Gather**: This can be implemented using asyncio tasks to manage parallel operations and gather results. Handling exceptions and rollbacks can be structured similarly to handling failures in distributed transactions.

> ok nice, let's do that

#### Generators for Asynchronous Flow Control
- **Generators as Building Blocks**: Python's generators could be a good conceptual fit for managing stages of RPC calls where each yield could represent a checkpoint or a state transition in the RPC flow. However, integrating them directly with asyncio might require wrappers or adapters since generators are not natively async.

> I'll need your help for this then.  It would be nice to have a syntactic sugar for this, maybe a decorator that turns a generator into an async function?  Or take something like pytorch's `torch.jit.script` and adapt it for this purpose?

#### Organization of Error Handling
- **Inclusion in Main Program Specification**: Integrating error handling into the RPC protocol itself, rather than treating it as an afterthought, can lead to more robust systems. Errors should be considered part of the normal operation flow, especially in distributed systems where partial failures are common.

> agreed, let's do that

### Proposed Next Steps

1. **Finalize the Design Choices**: Based on this discussion, decide on the specific technologies and patterns (like asyncio, MessagePack, CRDTs, and phased commit mechanisms).

> ok, take a look at the above and let me know if you have any further thoughts; otherwise let's follow your plan

2. **Implement Basic Components**: Start with basic async server and client components that can send and receive messages using UDP.
3. **Build Serialization and Deserialization Layers**: Implement or integrate MessagePack or another chosen format.
4. **Create RPC Method Decorators and Registry**: Develop the mechanism to mark methods as remotely callable and manage them in a registry.
5. **Error Handling and Reliability Protocols**: Design and implement the layers responsible for ensuring data integrity and reliability over the network.

### Response and Final Thoughts on Design Choices

#### CBOR vs. MessagePack
- **CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation)**: CBOR offers similar benefits to MessagePack but adds more data types and extensibility features. It's standardized and widely used in IoT and networking contexts where interoperability across different systems is critical.
- **MessagePack**: Offers efficient encoding and decoding and has a minimal data size. While slightly less flexible than CBOR, it's straightforward and has excellent library support in multiple languages.
  
Given your requirements, if extensibility and standard compliance are priorities, **CBOR** could be a better fit, especially if you plan to integrate with diverse systems or need additional data type support that CBOR offers.

#### Incorporating RAFT Consensus
- **RAFT for Asynchronous Systems**: Incorporating RAFT into an asynchronous, UDP-based system can be challenging due to RAFT's need for reliable communication and strong leader election mechanisms. It's feasible but requires careful adaptation to handle message loss and reordering:
  - **Message Reliability Layer**: You would need a layer to handle acknowledgments and retransmissions to ensure that RAFT messages reach their destination.
  - **Adaptation to Asynchrony**: RAFT typically operates in a more synchronous environment. Adapting it to an asynchronous model with asyncio will involve ensuring that state changes are handled atomically and that the system can cope with the inherent delays and inconsistencies of asynchronous operations.

#### Generator-based Asynchronous Flow Control
- **Syntactic Sugar with Decorators**: Creating a decorator to convert a generator into an async coroutine is a great idea. This would allow you to write code in a sequential style (which generators excel at) while still benefiting from non-blocking async operations. For example, this could look something like:
  ```python
  def async_generator(func):
      async def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
          gen = func(*args, **kwargs)
          try:
              while True:
                  yield await gen.__next__()
          except StopIteration:
              pass
      return wrapper
  ```
  This simple decorator could be a starting point to make generators behave asynchronously.

### Moving Forward with Implementation

Given the clarifications and preferences you've mentioned, here's how we can proceed:
1. **Select CBOR as the Serialization Format**: Given its advantages and suitability for your requirements.
2. **Explore RAFT Integration**: Begin with designing a simple reliable messaging layer suitable for adapting RAFT, understanding the complexity may increase.
3. **Implement Async Generators for Flow Control**: Develop and refine the decorator to integrate generators with asyncio effectively.
4. **Start with Basic Async Server and Client Components**: Utilizing asyncio for handling UDP messages and integrating the serialization/deserialization layers with CBOR.
5. **Develop RPC Method Decorators and Registry**: This will allow easy marking of methods as RPC-callable and automate their registration.
6. **Design and Implement Error Handling and Reliability Protocols**: Focus on robust error management and consider implementing a phased commit protocol as discussed.

If these steps align with your vision, we can start drafting the initial code for the basic server and client setup using asyncio and CBOR for serialization. Would you like to proceed with this, or are there any other adjustments or additions you'd like to consider?
